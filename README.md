Joke generator together.

1. [x] Create a GitHub repo for our project with a README.md, then start a Next.js application for generating jokes using AI.
2. [x] Implement a feature for users to customize joke parameters, such as topic (work, animals, etc.), tone (witty, silly, etc.), joke type (pun, knock-knock, etc.), language, and temperature (randomness).
3. [x] Construct the AI prompt based on these parameters, allowing users to generate jokes with a click and display them on the same page.
4. [x] Add a feature for the AI to evaluate jokes as "funny," "appropriate," or "offensive."
5. [ ] Experiment with prompts to optimize the AI for subjective tasks like humor.
6. [ ] Frontend development.
7. [ ] Debugging and submission.
